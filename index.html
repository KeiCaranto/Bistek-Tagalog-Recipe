    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol style="background-color: blanchedalmond">
      <li>
        In a bowl, combine beef, lemon juice, soy sauce, sliced onions, garlic,
        and pepper. Massage marinade into the meat and marinate for about 30
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove meat, onions, and garlic from marinade, squeezing and reserving
        excess liquid.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a pan over high heat, heat oil. Add beef and cook for about 3 to 5
        minutes per side or until lightly browned. Spoon out and reserve
        released meat juices during frying. Remove meat.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the pan, add onions and garlic, and cook, stirring regularly, until
        softened. Return browned beef to pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add reserved marinade and meat juices. Add water and bring to a boil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover, lower heat, and simmer for about 40 to 50 minutes or until meat
        is fork-tender and liquid is reduced. Season with salt to taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn off heat. Garnish with onion rings, if desired, and cover to allow
        onions to cook slightly in the steam. Serve hot.
      </li>
    </ol>
